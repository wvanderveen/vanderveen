                If traditional ethnography focuses its observations on the physical world, then digital ethnography shifts this focus to online spaces. This approach is not only convenient, it is also necessary as some information can only be accessed in the digital realm. In this project I explore how people use the common household yardstick not by barging into their homes or conducting surveys but by examining how they review it online.

              <h2 class="project-title-adjusted-2">“Good Ole Yardstick!”</h2>
              <p>
              Upon first look, yardsticks may not appear to be all that interesting. Like paper clips, key rings, traffic cones, and other everyday objects, they are cheap, easily replaceable, and can be found almost anywhere.</p>
              <p>
              When we take the time to consider yardsticks, however, something interesting happens. We begin to think about the times we've used them, how we've used them, and how their ubiquity has influenced how we use them. Because yardsticks can be found almost anywhere—stashed away in the corner of the classroom or inside your closet at home—they can easily be taken and repurposed for any context requiring a basic 36-inch-long stick. They can be used for measuring, sure, but also for tasks not associated with measuring: retrieving items that have fallen under furniture, stirring paint, propping up windows that won't stay open, etc.</p>
              <p>
              Drawing on my own experiences of repurposing tools, I decided to explore the idea that yardsticks can be used for things other than measuring by examining how people reviewed them online. I learned of many more use cases than my own and of some moments when certain yardsticks couldn't even be relied on for measuring—the one thing they're designed to do!</p>
              <p>
              This study brings up some important questions in regards to design: should designers try to anticipate, encourage, and/or prevent the repurposing of designed objects? Who is responsible for repurposing or misusing an object, the designer or the user? What do you think, dear reader?</p>
