                The Artist Detail Page (ADP) and Venue Detail Page (VDP) bring all relevant information on these topics to the forefront. Before the introduction of these features, details for artists and venues were nearly impossible to find, buried under far too many screens in the Ticketmaster app. Now presented alongside search, users have easy access to this information. I was fully responsible for these features’ designs including UX and UI.

                <main>In order to successfully relocate the artist and venue information, I needed to understand the structure of the Ticketmaster app, where this information was currently located, and where the most useful place to surface this information would be.</main>

                <title>Where to put this information?</title>
                <main>After some initial brainstorming, I determined that the best “page” for this information wouldn’t be a page at all.</main>
                <main>Instead, it would exist on half a page, where users could just push it away with the swipe of a finger.</main>
