                The Human Spirit Told Through Signage

                Design has lost its humanity. Although magnificent that good design is now considered a critically important dimension of life, the modern approach has stripped design of its idiosyncrasies. Globalization has disposed us toward mass-produced, assembly line aesthetics totally void of the human touch. As a result, we yearn for the odd, the unusual, the vernacular.</p>
                <p>
                It’s because of their scarcity and peculiarities that vernacular signs are often celebrated in the design community. Indeed, one can find many examples online praising their execution and craftsmanship. Many of these repositories do well to document these types of signs, but often fall short by only focusing on superficial details. In response to these efforts, I wanted to go one step further by not only celebrating these signs, but actually exploring the processes used to create them.</p>
                <p>
                Signmakers often must conform to physical constraints, navigating decisions on how best to compose messages (images 4 and 5), how to maintain versatility (image 2), how to utilize existing materials (image 7), and when to repurpose or amend existing signage (images 1, 3, and 6).</p>
                <p>
                By paying attention to these decisions after the fact, we glean insight into the signmaker’s process. This not only helps us better understand the creative process, but also how we as humans approach problem solving.</p>
