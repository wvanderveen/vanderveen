              <h2 class="project-title-adjusted-2">There is much to infer when paying attention to these characteristics—to the signs telling stories about how they were made.</h2>
              <p>
              Most signs require thoughtful deliberation in order to communicate effectively: how best to articulate a message, how best to compose it, when and how to maintain versatility, etc. But it's vernacular signs that inscribe these decisions directly onto the canvas itself, revealing the unique challenges of each sign and how each signmaker chose to address them.</p>
              <p>
              Because vernacular signmakers typically work with their hands, they don't have the luxury of using “Command+Z” nor can they resize elements once they realize they're too big or too small. Instead, they must respond to these issues on the fly. Much of what they decide can be inferred by paying attention to the inscriptions on the sign, such as when the word “parking” or “tacos” proves to be too long and the signmaker must figure out where to locate the remaining letters. In addition, vernacular signs can also reveal the more practical aspects of signmaking, such as when the hours of operation or price of cigarettes change (but the change isn't significant enough, in the eyes of the signmaker, to warrant making a whole new sign).</p>
              <p>
              When signmakers do have the luxury of designing with software, such as with the pink “breakfast” sign, what can be inferred is different but still rich. What the composition of this sign reveals is how volatile the location of breakfast for these events actually is. Instead of printing different signs with arrows facing different directions, why not print one sign that you can spin around? Then you can have one solution that supports all contexts.</p>
