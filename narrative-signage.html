                The Human Spirit Told Through Signage
              </h2>
              <div class="column-content">
                <p>
                Like many of my peers, I appreciate unique design. This is especially true when it comes to signage: in a globalized society where much of the two-dimensional landscape is dominated by mass produced specimens void of human influence, vernacular signage is something to cherish.</p>
                <p>
                It’s because of their scarcity that vernacular signs are often celebrated in the design community. Indeed, one can find many examples online praising their execution and craftsmanship. In doing this project, I wanted to continue to celebrate these uniquely made signs, but with a particular focus on the processes used to create them (and how these processes have affected the end products).</p>
                <p>
                Signmakers often must conform to physical constraints, navigating decisions on how best to compose messages (images 4 and 5), how to maintain versatility (image 2), when to repurpose or amend existing signage (images 1, 3, and 6), and when to utilize existing materials (image 7).</p>
                <p>
                By paying attention to these decisions (after the fact), we are able to glean insight into the process of the signmaker. This not only helps us better understand the creative process, but also how we as humans approach problem solving.</p>
