                  Of the six team principles that Ticketmaster encourages, “Be Transparent” is its fifth.
                  <span class="content-extended">It reads, “we think open communication provides the best environment for real feedback, which keeps us aligned and helps us continually improve. Shortly after Ticketmaster acquired Two Toasters, the former Two Toasters design team sought to visualize these principles as posters, with each designer making one poster. As the designer of the “Be Transparent” poster, I chose to exploit the irony of the smoke signal, one of the oldest and most opaque methods of communication. The visual style of the poster draws inspiration from the German plakatstil.</span>

                  Based in Chapel Hill, Reflective Image of NC is a regional car detailing service that specializes in paint correction for luxury cars.
                  <span class="content-extended">For this rebrand, it was important to consider not only what the new brand should be, but also the foundation upon which the original brand was built. In making the new identity, I took cues from high-end culture and clothing traditions as well as typical styles amongst the most respected luxury vehicles. In addition, it is no mistake that the logo itself takes on a “reflective” quality.</span>
