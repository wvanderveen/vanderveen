              <p class="project-content">
                The Ticketmaster App home screen redesign effort (Android) was part of a larger initiative to improve the browse and search experiences for both iOS and Android. <span class="content-extended">Within the totality of the design work, I focused on the browse experience (UX and UI) for Android, working closely with another designer focused on the browse experience for iOS. Due to technical limitations, not all design work could be implemented. However, the breadth and quality of the work influenced the direction of multiple other products within the Ticketmaster organization.</span>

                Designed in the reverse-stress style, this typeface was made to fill a void: there are no reverse-stress typefaces that are solely lowercase. <span class="content-extended">If any lowercase reverse-stress characters do exist, their forms usually adopt whatever system was established for their uppercase counterparts. This typeface places lowercase forms at primary importance, while also incorporating motifs from textura quadrata (gothic blackletter). The “a” character heavily influenced the system that was established for the rest of the typeface.</span>

                Based in Chapel Hill, Reflective Image of NC is a regional car detailing service that specializes in paint correction for luxury cars. <span class="content-extended">For this rebrand, it was important to consider not only what the new brand should be, but also the foundation upon which the original brand was built.

In addition, it is no mistake that the logo itself takes on a “reflective” quality.</span>

As the designer of the “Be Transparent” poster, I chose to exploit the irony of the smoke signal, one of the oldest and most opaque methods of communication.
