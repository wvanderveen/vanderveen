                The ADP (Artist Detail Page) and VDP (Venue Detail Page) bring all relevant information on these topics to the forefront. <span class="content-extended">Before the introduction of these features, users could hardly find any content related to artists or venues in the Ticketmaster app. For artists, this information includes descriptions about the artist and set lists from past performances. For venues, this information includes parking and venue information as well as the venue’s address and phone number.</span>

                Apple TV App: Loading Spinner
              </h2>
              <p class="project-content">
                This loading spinner—styled to look like a traditional perforated ticket—was designed for Ticketmaster’s Apple TV app. <span class="content-extended">Making a good loading spinner requires addressing a couple needs: the spinner must appear to proceed in a linear sequence (in order for the illusion of progress to be apparent), and the spinner must vary in rhythm (so that there is an obvious sense of pacing). The ticket’s rip, rotation, and pause address these needs, while also allowing the spinner to pay homage to the classic material experience of ripping a ticket.</span>

              <p class="project-content">
                The Ticketmaster App home screen redesign effort (Android) was part of a larger initiative to improve the browse and search experiences for both iOS and Android. <span class="content-extended">Within the totality of the design work, I focused on the browse experience (UX and UI) for Android, working closely with another designer focused on the browse experience for iOS. Due to technical limitations, not all design work could be implemented. However, the breadth and quality of work influenced the direction of multiple other products within the Ticketmaster organization.</span>

                SafeTech Kids NC (initially called “NC SafeTech 4 Kids” before the design effort) is a nonprofit that focuses on safe technology use for kids. <span class="content-extended">Based in Asheville, it works to inform parents on the potential health risks that wifi radiation may pose, while also suggesting ways to reduce unnecessary exposure. Despite the seriousness of this topic, I wanted the brand to take on positive overtones: the friendly shapes and bright brand color intentionally celebrate children’s health and playfulness.</span>

                Based in Chapel Hill, Reflective Image of NC is a regional car detailing service that specializes in paint correction for luxury cars. <span class="content-extended">For this rebrand, it was important to consider not only what the new brand should be, but also the foundation upon which the original brand was built. In making the new identity, I took cues from high-end culture and clothing traditions as well as typical styles amongst the most respected luxury vehicles. In addition, it is no mistake that the logo itself takes on a “reflective” quality.</span>

                Of the six team principles that Ticketmaster encourages, “Be Transparent” is its fifth. It reads, “we think open communication provides the best environment for real feedback, which keeps us aligned and helps us continually improve.” <span class="content-extended">Our design team was tasked with visualizing these principles as posters. As the designer of the “Be Transparent” poster, I chose to exploit the irony of the smoke signal, one of the oldest and most opaque methods of communication. The visual style of the poster draws inspiration from the German plakatstil.</span>

In addition to devotional use, the app also allows users to find and plan for religious events.</span>
