                Celebrating the achievement of middle school math
              </h2>
              <p class="project-content">
                Middle school math can be intimidating. Not only is the subject matter different, it is also more complex. Topics like algebra, geometry, fractions, decimals, and ratios are all new and require much more critical thinking than what students are typically used to. As students transition to middle school math (and middle school in general), it is important to recognize them—to celebrate their accomplishments and give encouragement every step of the way. This set of achievement badges offers bright colors and fun, age-appropriate illustrations in hopes of doing just that.

                <main>We kicked off this project with a typical visual design approach/methodology:</main>
                <main>I audited Zearn’s existing elementary school badges, researched other badges for inspiration, and sketched and iterated over and over until I eventually found a direction that my team was happy with.</main>

                <main>Things were going smoothly until we got into the details. <b>One of the details our team had different opinions on was the mission badges’ expressions:</b></main>
                <main><b>What kind of eyes should they have?</b></main>

                <title>Approach: Product design</title>
                <main>Instead of choosing a direction at random (or yielding to the loudest opinion in the room), <b>I proposed that we address this question democratically by leveraging product design methodology.</b></main>
                <main><b>That is, putting a few badges with different eyes in front of middle schoolers to see what they liked best.</b></main>

                <main>Since we developed this project during Covid, we conducted our tests remotely.</main>
                <main>We reached out to middle schoolers via our partnering schools, then conducted our tests using InVision and Zoom.</main>

                <title>Findings</title>
                <main>After several rounds of testing, we found that 1) students liked the badge direction overall, 2) students liked our color choices for the badges, and 3) <b>students preferred the eyes in columns C and D, but would also prefer different eyes for different badges rather than all badges having the same eyes.</b></main>

                <title>Reflections</title>
                <main>These findings were huge. Not only did they help our team find a path forward, <b>they also proved that user testing could be used to solve not just product design challenges but visual design challenges as well.</b></main>
                <main>In addition, by opening up a conversation with our target audience, we were better able to ensure that our set of badges were appropriate for middle school.</main>
